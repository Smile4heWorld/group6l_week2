# Exercise 2b

## Summary
Hi-C sequencing is a chromosome conformation capture technique that maps the three-dimensional organization of the genome. In this method, chromatin is crosslinked to preserve physical interactions between DNA regions. The DNA is then cut with restriction enzymes, and the ends are filled in with biotin-labeled nucleotides before being ligated togetherâ€”joining DNA fragments that were spatially close in the nucleus. After crosslink reversal and sequencing, the paired reads indicate which genomic loci were in proximity. Computational analysis converts these contact frequencies into genome-wide interaction maps, revealing chromatin loops, topologically associating domains (TADs), and higher-order nuclear architecture.

We used ChatGPT and prompted "okay now do the same for "Hi-C-Seq".
